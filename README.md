# Flutter TFLite Image Classification

This Flutter project demonstrates image classification using a TensorFlow Lite model. The app enables users to pick an image, processes it using a pre-trained TFLite model, and displays the results.

## Features

- **Image Selection**: Pick an image using the device camera.
- **TensorFlow Lite Integration**: Uses TFLite for efficient image classification.
- **Real-Time Results**: Displays the classification results along with inference time.
